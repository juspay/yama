design_patterns:
  - name: "Unified Context Pattern"
    category: "performance"
    description: "Gather all PR context once and reuse across operations"
    usage: "Prevents redundant API calls and improves performance"
    implementation:
      - "ContextGatherer collects all data upfront"
      - "Operations receive pre-gathered context"
      - "Context includes PR info, diffs, and project context"
    example_files:
      - "src/core/ContextGatherer.ts"
      - "src/core/Guardian.ts"
  
  - name: "Provider Abstraction"
    category: "extensibility"
    description: "Abstract git platform operations for future extensibility"
    usage: "Allows easy addition of GitHub, GitLab support"
    implementation:
      - "BitbucketProvider implements platform-specific logic"
      - "Core features work with abstract interfaces"
    example_files:
      - "src/core/providers/BitbucketProvider.ts"
  
  - name: "Smart Diff Strategy"
    category: "performance"
    description: "Adaptive diff fetching based on PR size"
    usage: "Optimizes API usage and AI processing"
    implementation:
      - "Whole diff for small PRs (≤2 files by default)"
      - "File-by-file for larger PRs (≥3 files)"
      - "Configurable thresholds via YAML"
    example_files:
      - "src/core/ContextGatherer.ts"
    related_patterns:
      - "Unified Context Pattern"

  - name: "Lazy Loading Pattern"
    category: "performance"
    description: "Dynamic imports for ESM modules to avoid build issues"
    usage: "Load NeuroLink and MCP modules at runtime"
    implementation:
      - "Use eval-based dynamic import"
      - "Initialize only when needed"
    example_files:
      - "src/core/Guardian.ts"
      - "src/features/CodeReviewer.ts"

caching_strategies:
  - name: "Hierarchical Cache Keys"
    description: "Structured cache keys for easy invalidation"
    format: "{operation}:{workspace}:{repository}:{identifier}:{params}"
    ttl_strategy:
      branch_info: "1 hour"
      pr_details: "30 minutes"
      pr_diff: "30 minutes"
      file_content: "2 hours"
      project_context: "2 hours"
  
  - name: "Context Caching"
    description: "Cache entire unified context for reuse"
    benefits:
      - "90% reduction in API calls"
      - "Faster subsequent operations"
      - "Consistent data across features"

error_handling_patterns:
  - name: "Graceful Degradation"
    description: "Continue processing even if some operations fail"
    implementation:
      - "Catch errors per operation"
      - "Report failures without stopping"
      - "Provide partial results"
  
  - name: "Detailed Error Context"
    description: "Include context in all error messages"
    implementation:
      - "Custom error classes with context"
      - "Operation-specific error handling"
      - "User-friendly error messages"
